f you wana try something new in deserts...then please do visit this place just to relish one spanish delicacy "churros with milk choclate dip" from the hoard of dishes listed on the menu. The san churros come in three sizes...pico with three pieces, medio with six and fiesta with 12. It so happens that it is more advisable to order a medio itself in the first go as you would be definitely tempted to order another pico after relishing the first. I also tried rocky road pastry but it didn't turn out so well as churros!!

The pasta in red sauce looked more like pasta in orange sauce but it was appetizing enough. The garlic bread was quite garlicky but pleasant. While finishing the puff, our churros arrived. We had ordered for one dark chocolate pot and one milk chocolate pot. The churros were absolute heaven. They were warm, crunchy on the outside and a hint of softness in the inside. Portion size was good and quite filing. We loved it so much that we ordered for another portion. The ambience was pleasant and the staff was prompt. Overall, a highly recommended place for the spanish churro fix.

A casual evening stroll led us to this place. And I must say, this is quite impressive. 
We tried the dark hot chocolate - absolutely amazing! A must try! We also ordered coffee, which was good. The desserts spread looked impressive. Will be on the watch list for further sweet tooth tingles - esp. the traditional churros.

A personal favorite. I love the place. Its a two store Chocolaterie. Lower section has a huge counter with various pastries, chocolates, etc on displays which is mouth watering. Upper section has seating arrangements. 

The best is churro's with melted chocolate. They offer 3 types of melted chocolates: dark, milk and white; milk is the best. Their chocolate fondues are also amazing.
