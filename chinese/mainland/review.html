I had visited this branch for sunday brunch and had a great time with the food here. Huge variety of starters and main course. But I mostly fancy the starters and dessert as compared to the main course.

Its a busy place on a weekend filled families and their kids so make a reservation or go before time.

Great ambiance,  good service and authentic "Un-Indianized" Chinese food. In simple words that is all about Mainland china.

Definitely the best chinese I have ever had. Really authentic and yummy. Also this is the best of the mainland China branches. I have been to a few and they weren't as good as these. The food is outstanding no doubt about that but the ambience is also breathtaking. I loved the service too. Very courteous.

If it's Chinese then it has to be mainland china ... This restaurant just does not let me down anytime . The taste is just getting better and better every day . The countless times I have been to this restaurant I have always enjoyed the ambience , the staff and the food .
