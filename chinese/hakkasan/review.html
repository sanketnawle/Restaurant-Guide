The decor is tres chic for me. The food had flavours exploding in my mouth. The French beans, the aubergine was probably was the best not only the spices but the ingredient itself was tasty. The crème brulé had perfectly burnt (torched) sugar crust, the tofu Aubergine dish would be best tofu dish I had. The set lunch veg menu with tasting potion was perfectly agreeable to my taste buds

Having heard about the Hakkasan london offerings, I was pretty keen to take a turn around and as they say, learnt quite a lot – They do not have Indian Liquor and have some really rare ones also. The bar itself is worth a visit.

The dim, blue lighting, cascading water effects, burnished wood accents, and deep chocolate leather banquettes create an oasis of exquisite calm that soothe the most jaded of jetsetters. Balancing Eastern flavours can be hard, and muddling and stirring them into a cocktail needs some Tom Cruisetype talent. Do try the kumquat mojito, with astringent rum, the sweet of kumquats tumbled with lime and mint for firsthand evidence.

The desserts were tantalizing – blueberry sorbet with what looked like a blueberry cheesecake, the mango one and creme brulee was excellent as well. In fact, the desserts were demolished in double quick time so to speak.
