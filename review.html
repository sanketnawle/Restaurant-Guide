The music was pulsating, loud and almost hypnotic in its rhythm. I could see my friend next to me mouth some words to me, but for the life of me I could not understand what she was saying. Like an aged man, I kept on repeating What?? while progressively leaning closer and closer to pick up on what she was saying. It took a progressive degree of leaning from me until she finally got through to me.

I have been to Boveda once and absolutely loved the place esp. the ambience. Very causal, chic and warm. Place to catch up with friends and unwind after a long day and finally extend the night to some amazing tunes and spins. Their offers are really good and worth a try. The bar is very interesting esp. the lights design and I am a big fan of the bar table and bar stool. Once can sit in a corner and get a good view of the whole place, yet enjoy a few drinks quietly.
