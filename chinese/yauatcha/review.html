Man - this is easily in my top 5 restaurants in Mumbai. I travel to HK / Guangdong quite a bit and Yauatcha is the closest one can come to good quality Cantonese food in India

The best Chinese food in Mumbai.
The staff is very good they go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable.

The ambience is very urban and classy. 

The food is out of this world.

I will surely want to recommend
The truffle dim sum.

The customer service at Yauatcha is a class apart. A special mention for Mr Nelson who welcomed us warmly and got us a table despite it being a busy saturday night. 
Kudos! 
Food was excellent. Plenty of options for vegetarians. Its pricey; yes, but the food, service and ambience are to match.

Ordered for assorted dumplings, which were decent but not mind blowing. The fried turnip cake is a definite recommendation for all. Spicy aubergine, sato bean and okra dish was a complete delicacy.
