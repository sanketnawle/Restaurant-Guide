It's absolutely accurate to list Ling's under the category of Legendary. Opened in 1945 (unless my eyes deceive me to misread the board outside), this authentic representation of Chinese food has had me stumped on each of my three visits here so far.

Finally had a chance to have lunch at Lings , considering all the hype, the place did not live up to it's expectations. The ambience is a sad with no music. We ordered bacon wrapped prawns, very very average, tasted like something you could easily make at home. The slices pork had a nice texture and great flavour

This place requires more credit and recognition. One of the best restaurants for Chinese cuisine..nothing I've ever had here has disappointed me..the ambience is unique and soothing..with a blend of green and blue lighting. Even the decor is such that you leave all your worries behind.

The ambience is very cosy and welcoming. We ordered DimSum platter.. there were 3 types of dimsums with 2 portions of each. 2 of them were awesome but the 3rd variety was really unappetizing.. After hearing a lot about blasting chicken, we decided to try it.. It was tasty but not as great as it is hyped to be.

Have been a loyal patron of The Ling's Pavilion since the year dot. Since Im from Kolkata, and most others from my city are very proud of Tyangra and its Chinese food and never thought that any other place would make me swear by its Chinese food. Love the decor, dim green and blue lights, a variety of Chinese elements, the famous bridge and a fountain. The ambience is magically transports you to another landscape altogether.
