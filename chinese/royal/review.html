The ambience is appealing, but short of what I would call romantic. It's softly lit with warm light, and there are dividers between most tables for something along the lines of privacy and decor.

The staff is pretty good at the harder aspects of their job. The food comes a tad slowly, but not enough to really make a fuss about. The kimchi is excellent (especially the Pumpkin in it).

The food was a gross let down. Everything tasted the same. We ordered 5 types of dimsums, 3 types of cheung fun and a crispy prawn dimsum too. I wouldn't recommend this place, in all honesty.

Service was ok. Ordered for flaming chicken but it was just about alright. Same goes with the dimsums.
