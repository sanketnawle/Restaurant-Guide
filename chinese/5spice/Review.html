5 spice is one of the best Chinese outlet to which I have been to in Mumbai. Apart from the fact that they serve some really good Chinese food and great desserts the best thing is that it wouldn't cost you a lot.

Have been visiting this place since 4 years now and is easily one of my favorite chinese restaurants in Mumbai. Family friendly portions which make this place an absolute value for money is the unique selling proposition of this chain. The food is definitely not authentic chinese and cooking style is deliberately tweaked to suit Indian taste buds.

For a regular college-student-foodie like me, this place is where I give out my treats. Everyone leaves full and I save quite a bit of money thanks to the generosity of the 5 Spice owners who give you more food than you'd expect.When you do go there, do not order too many items for variety, you will not be able to finish it and you need space for Mission Impossible
