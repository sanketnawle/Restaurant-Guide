  Lovely place, wonderful ambience, good music and my favourite place in Bandra for a drink. Love the Hoegaarden beer here, one of my favourites.

The place itself didn’t have much of a crowd which was fine. Didn’t like the ambience and the general setup though. Food and drinks were quite average. I’d rather go to Big Bang which is in a different wing of the same building. Big Bang is much better. Perhaps Bonobo is more happening when there is a crowd..so maybe Friday nights and Saturday nights, the scene is better.

I loved the open space arena! They should change the sound systems though! So what we ordered were: Sautéed chicken sausages, Balsamic mushroom as starters and both were top notch yummy! Mushroom was too good! Sausages are always yummy!

Really liked this place. Open air, good music, very lively and picks up a lot after 1130. We had the red wine sangria pitcher which was quite strong and quite yum. Ordered the tempura prawns with wasabi Mayo. Very good starter - not too oily. Went on to the prawn pasta in red sauce. Replaced penne with spaghetti. Damn good. A little heavy so couldnt finish it even though I was really hungry. A good place to chill on a Saturday evening.

The ambience is like really good to spend a nice and loud evening with your friends. The loud music just adds to the fervor.We liked the variety and the dishes were in general pretty much palatable. We had a good time. This place is recommended!
