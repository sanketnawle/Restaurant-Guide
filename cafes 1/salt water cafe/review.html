Wowza! Nice place, great ambience, quick service and great food. Enough said already.

Was on a splash and dash routine across town and colleague suggest this place. Ordered the pepper crostini, Greek salad and fresh lime. And colleague went with a Spanish omelette. I polished off the place sparkling clean and promised to be back for desserts next time!

The ambience is really nice, friendly or romantic, could go either way. I actually loved the fact that the music wasn't loud, letting conversation actually possible. We ordered the Polenta Crusted Chicken (Above Average), the Seared Basa (Awesome!) and Lemon Pie (Good!) for our meal. Also had a kiwi refreshing drink which was genuinely refreshing. Overall, definitely worth going to multiple times, great food, great ambience and decently fast service!

Salt Water Café popularly known as SWC for the frequent goers! SWC caters to the loners, family, kids, business people, girls night out or an office celebration. The casual ambience with the attentive staff has always been a great experience.The added dishes on the menu are good and was needed to keep the regulars craving for more. My favorite being the chicken burger - delicately flavored, fries and the coleslaw with the mustard dressing is an all time fav. My recent discovery of the tomato- mozzarella- aurugula salad , which is so fresh and flavored is going be a MUST HAVE on the table for a while now

 The ambience is very welcoming and warm, and the menu doesn't disappoint you. I have come here on 2-3 occasions. Once, I just had their veg starters and bruchettas. Both were quite good. And then I returned twice for their breakfast since I had heard a lot about it. The masala omlette, warm syrupy waffles and salads were an extremely delightful experience. They gave an extra kick to my Sunday :). Expensive but worth it I would say. All that is left to try there, is their mouth watering desserts that grace the counter at the entrance.
